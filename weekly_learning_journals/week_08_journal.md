- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeigarnik_effect

### Estimated hours

Around 5 hours

### Content insights

Similar to last week, my main focus was PHP. Most of my time was spent on learning and working towards the group project therefore most of my content insights were very similar to last week.  

Gulp is a JavaScript based task runner used in frontend development to automate things like compile CSS from SAS files, compress and optimize images, Concatenating files and make it easier to update your browser with your latest code and access the current development site using other devices on the network, such as smartphones. Gulp runs on Node.js, and tasks are written in a file called gulpfile.js.


### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

#### Hypothesis
In [week 5](week_05_journal.md) I conducted a learning experiment. If I focus on completing one task at a time and take  5-10 minute breaks between each task, I will feel less stressed, more productive and procrastinate less compared to when I looked at a project as one large workload and took on May things at the same time.

#### Experiment
- __Old Strategy:__ In earlier weeks, I took on many tasks at the same time and kept working on projects for extended periods until I eventually completed them. I was physically and mentally exhausted, and I started to procrastinate more. This pushed me away from doing the weekly practicals, learning new content, and working on assignments because the thought of going through that experience was enough to put me off.
- __New Strategy:__ From week 5, I broke down everything I did into smaller, manageable tasks. When I did the practicals, I only did one small task, such as creating one PHP function and testing it. When I wrote my journals, I did them one section at a time. When I watched learning videos on LinkedIn, I watched them one at a time. When I researched learning resources, I only researched one thing at a time. 

#### Results and Findings
 - I found myself feeling less stressed and was motivated to learn and complete projects.
 - Completing a small task gave me a sense of relief and accomplishment because I achieved a goal.
 - I didn't feel the usual pressure of a massive workload, and instead, I was making progress at a steady pace.
 - The 5-10 breaks helped me refresh physically and mentally
 - I also felt more productive than usual and, overall, completed more than I typically would in a study session.

During my research about focusing on tasks and procrastination, I came across something called The Zeigarnik Effect. This is a _"psychological phenomenon where people tend to remember interrupted or incomplete tasks or events more easily than those that have been completed."_ Our brains love to complete things. When we start something and can't finish it straight away, it makes us feel uneasy and creates discomfort, so we resist getting started on things to avoid that feeling. This can make you procrastinate more because the tasks feel too big. You end up overthinking instead of doing something and feeling guilty about it. Something i learned was that, procrastination isn’t being lazy, but it’s your brain trying to protect you from the discomfort of open loops.

My experiment aims to fix this by breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. I can trick my brain by only working on small tasks that can be done in 15–20 minutes. Completing these smaller tasks gave me a sense of accomplishment without the added stress of a large workload. The 5–10 minute breaks I took helped me refresh physically and mentally. This increased my motivation to study and learn more, and I felt prepared for the next study session and to work on tasks.
