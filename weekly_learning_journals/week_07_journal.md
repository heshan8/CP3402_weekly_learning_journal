### Content insights

PHP is a server-side scripting language used with HTML to build websites.  
I learned that every parameter in PHP starts with a "$" and every statement must end with a semicolon. Php code must run inside a <?php ?> tag
otherwise the code will not work.  
Arrays in PHP are flexible, and you can store structured data without having to use classes.  
PHP can automatically convert between different data types (string, float, int). For example if you  use a number as a string  
in an equation PHP wil automatically convert it into an integer. This may help you as a beginner, but it is better to type correctly.  


### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

PHP is highly scalable and used heavily in the industry. Having no experience in PHP or similar languages like C and JavaScript, I struggle with PHP for a bit.  
This week I practiced more and followed a PHP tutorial that covers the basics and im feeling a bit more confident. I thought PHP was a replacement language for HTML, 
but now I realize it was designed to be embedded in HTML. It was great to see PHP running so seamlessly with HTML.
