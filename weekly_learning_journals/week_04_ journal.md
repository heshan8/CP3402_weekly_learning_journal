### Estimated hours

Around 4 hours

### Content insights

This week, I learned the difference between local development and deployment. Local development is working on a site on my own computer locally, and deployment is publishing it on a live server online for user access. I learned that when using WordPress or any other CMS, a database must be used to store and retrieve variable information. For example, if I had to create a sign-up and login form, I would have to use an SQL database to store user data. When using XAMPP, I learned that WordPress was running on an Apache server. NGINX is better for static content and high-traffic sites such as WordPress.org and Adobe.com, while Apache is better for dynamic content such as Slack and Netflix. I also learned that a CI/CD pipeline (Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment) is used to streamline development, testing, and deployment. For example, a CI system performs automated tests to check for errors in the code, and after passing the tests, updates are sent to a staging server before going live.Interesting thing I found when writing commits is to see if my commit message completes the sentence "Apply this patch to" and It worked quite well.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Developers use local development to test and customize website features in a controlled environment, making it a crucial part of the development process. Knowing how to properly deploy and manage a site makes me more employable as a CMS administrator or web developer. Last week, I started taking 15-minute breaks every hour to help with learning. I have kept it up, and it has been helping me focus better while working on tasks. I can see that this is beneficial to me regardless of my career.
