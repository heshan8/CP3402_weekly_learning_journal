### Content insights
Docker is a platform that lets you create and deploy applications in portable containers that are similar to a virtual machine.  
You can use docker compose to run multiple containers in a single system using a config file instead of docker commands.  
I learned that these containers work by packaging an application along with its dependencies. This lets you run the application across different systems without compatability issues.  
If you are working in a team, you can share the docker image for easy collaboration ensuring everyone is working inside the same environment.  


### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I previously thought that during stand-up meetings you worked on tasks and went up until they were completed.  
While watching the LinkedIn learning videos, I learned that stand-up is a short meeting where you only discuss your progress and roadblocks.
