### Estimated hours

Around 5 hours

### Content insights
Child themes allow you to make changes to a website without modifying the main theme, helping to avoid breaking site functionality.  
Without a child theme, modifying main theme files can lead to changes that could be lost during updates. This is because a child theme keeps custom CSS and PHP modifications separate from the parent theme.

Child themes are also a good method of testing functions and styles without changing the main theme. This way, if something goes wrong, the parent theme remains untouched.

Child themes briefly introduced me to PHP. Coming from using Python, PHP was different and is only used for backend web development, unlike Python, which is a general-purpose programming language.

I am still not feeling confident about PHP due to not spending enough time on it. I will have to practice more in my own time.


### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week, I followed some tutorials and tried to redo them without looking at the guides, but I couldn't. I kept getting stuck and forgetting certain steps. Next week, I will be allocating extra time for practice.

When I'm working on a project, I find myself getting stressed out about the workload easily and end up procrastinating. This week, I tried something new.  
Instead of focusing on the whole project, I focused on completing one task at a time. After completing that one task, I took a small break.

This works very well with the strategy I started using in an earlier week, where I began taking a small break every hour.  
This gave me a sense of relief and accomplishment because I achieved a goal. I also felt productive and less stressed.
