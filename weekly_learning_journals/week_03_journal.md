### Estimated hours

Around 4 hours

### Content insights

WordPress is more refined compared to joomla. The functionality was similar for both platforms and WordPress had a bigger selection of modules and themes. Watching linked in learning videos was  helpful in getting started with creating and publishing content on WordPress. I learned a bit about child themes and their functionality which will help me prepare for upcoming practicals. I also learned the difference between wordpress.com and .org and the difference between a post and a page.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Learning CMS can be quite challenging and time-consuming at times. I worked on learning activities and site content for extended periods, making me feel tired and less productive. This week, I started taking 15-minute breaks every hour, which helped me de-stress and feel more relaxed physically. This also helped me remember the things I learned better.

The group interview process felt similar to a job interview. Almost everyone I talked to had very similar questions about organizing skills, availability, conflict resolution, etc. The questions were worded differently, but they followed the same formula. This made some of the interviews feel like a boring Q&A session, and I struggled to listen actively. I tried to change this by not writing a list of questions and instead focused on having a friendly conversation, which worked well to a certain extent.

I found that asking casual ice-breaker questions about everyday things increased the dynamic, and I felt more relaxed. For example, I complimented someone's laptop, and it immediately improved their mood. The issue was that this led to longer conversations, and I kept running out of time, but the conversations I did have seemed productive. I feel that this helped build trust with the other person, which led to thoughtful and honest conversations.

From the interviews, I learned that when it comes to teamwork, group dynamics and communication play an important role. There is no point in working with group members who fit the criteria if you don't get along well with them. As the interviews went on, I learned that instead of being direct and putting people on the spot, asking more flexible questions involving a real-life situation got better answers and gave me insight into how they think rather than how they act.
